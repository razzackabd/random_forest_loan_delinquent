# random_forest_loan_delinquent
Loan Delinquency Prediction Using Random Forest (LA Loan Dataset)

📖 Project Description

This project aims to predict loan delinquency using the LA Loan Dataset by applying the Random Forest machine learning algorithm.
The objective is to classify borrowers as delinquent or non-delinquent based on their financial, credit, and demographic information.

Random Forest is selected due to its robustness, high accuracy, and ability to handle complex and non-linear relationships while reducing overfitting.
